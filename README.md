# node-identity-generator

The task was to build an application that generates an array of 20 random identities that will save to a people.json file. Just running the node app.js command should immediately generate a people.json file with the data.

Once complete, the console should show a success message - "File has been successfully generated! Check people.json" or about a possible failure - "Something went wrong".
